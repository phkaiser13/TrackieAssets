# Test Data

This directory contains small data samples used for unit and integration tests. The data here should be minimal and representative of the data models will process.

Examples include:
- Sample images (`.jpg`, `.png`)
- Short audio clips (`.wav`)
- Snippets of text (`.txt`)

**Note:** Do not add large files to this directory. Large test datasets should be stored in a separate, versioned storage (like S3) and downloaded by test scripts as needed.
