# Security Policy

The Trackie team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please use the "Report a vulnerability" feature on GitHub.

Alternatively, you can send an email to the project maintainers at `security@trackie.ai` (this is a placeholder address).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any proof-of-concept code or scripts.
- The version of the affected code.

## Disclosure Policy

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.
- We will provide a timeline for addressing the vulnerability and will keep you informed of our progress.
- We will coordinate with you on the public disclosure of the vulnerability. We prefer to disclose vulnerabilities after a fix has been developed and is available.

We thank you for your help in keeping Trackie secure.
