# Common Scripts

This directory contains utility scripts that are shared across the entire repository.

These scripts handle tasks such as:
- Model format conversion (e.g., PyTorch to ONNX).
- Model quantization (e.g., creating GGUF versions).
- Checksum verification for ensuring data integrity.
- Syncing with cloud storage for large artifacts.
