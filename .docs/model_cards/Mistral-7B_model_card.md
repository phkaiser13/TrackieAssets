# Model Card: Mistral-7B

## Model Details
- **Model Name:** Mistral-7B
- **Version:** 1.0.0 (placeholder)
- **Description:** A 7-billion parameter language model optimized for a variety of natural language tasks. This version is integrated into the TrackieLLM runtime.
- **Authors:** Mistral AI (original model), Trackie Team (integration, fine-tuning, and quantization)
- **License:** Apache-2.0

## Technical Specifications
- **Weights SHA256:** `[To be filled upon release]`
- **Formats Available:** GGUF (llama.cpp compatible), ONNX (where applicable)
- **Quantization Levels:** FP16, 4-bit, 8-bit

## Training
- **Training Data Summary:** Fine-tuned on a combination of in-house safety-filtered web crawls, instruction tuning corpora, and domain-specific industrial logs.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Tokenization using SentencePiece/BPE.
  - Data deduplication and safety filtering.
  - Handling of variable context lengths.
- **Fine-tuning Method:** Primarily LoRA (r=8, alpha=32), with full fine-tuning used for specific versions.
- **Reproducibility:**
    - **Training Script:** `[To be provided]`
    - **Hyperparameters File:** `[To be provided]`
    - **Dockerfile / Environment:** `[To be provided]`

## Usage and Limitations
- **Intended Use:** General-purpose language understanding and generation, including summarization, question answering, and instruction following within the TrackieLLM and TrackieLINK systems.
- **Limitations:** The model may generate incorrect or biased information. It should not be used for critical decisions without human oversight. Performance is highly dependent on the quantization level and hardware.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Perplexity, BLEU (for relevant tasks), and instruction-following benchmarks.

## Security and Privacy
- **Security & Privacy Notes:** The model is fine-tuned on data that has been filtered for safety and to remove PII. However, it may still generate sensitive information. Implement safeguards and content filtering in production environments. Responsible AI guidelines, including bias testing and opt-out mechanisms, are followed.
