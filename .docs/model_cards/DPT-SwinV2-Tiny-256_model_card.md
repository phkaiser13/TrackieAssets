# Model Card: DPT-SwinV2-Tiny-256

## Model Details
- **Model Name:** DPT-SwinV2-Tiny-256
- **Version:** 1.0.0 (placeholder)
- **Description:** A lightweight, transformer-based model for monocular depth estimation. It uses a DPT (Dense Prediction Transformer) head with a Swin Transformer v2 backbone (Tiny variant), optimized for 256x256 resolution inputs.
- **Authors:** Original model authors, Trackie Team (integration and optimization)
- **License:** Apache-2.0

## Technical Specifications
- **Weights SHA256:** `[To be filled upon release]`
- **Formats Available:** ONNX, TorchScript
- **Quantization Levels:** FP16, INT8 (with calibration)

## Training
- **Training Data Summary:** Trained on MiDaS datasets and/or custom internal depth estimation datasets.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Resize input images to 256x256 pixels.
  - Normalize using ImageNet mean and standard deviation.
  - Augmentations: Horizontal flip, color jitter.
- **Reproducibility:**
    - **Training Script:** `[To be provided]`
    - **Hyperparameters File:** `[To be provided]`
    - **Dockerfile / Environment:** `[To be provided]`

## Usage and Limitations
- **Intended Use:** Monocular depth estimation for applications like 3D reconstruction, computational photography, and autonomous navigation assistance within the TrackieLINK system.
- **Limitations:** The model provides relative, not metric, depth. Accuracy may be lower for out-of-distribution images or scenes with challenging lighting. Not suitable for applications requiring high-precision depth measurement without calibration.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Scale-invariant log root mean squared error (SiLg RMSE), absolute relative difference (AbsRel).

## Security and Privacy
- **Security & Privacy Notes:** The model processes images but does not store them. Users should ensure that input images do not contain sensitive or private information. The model is not known to have specific security vulnerabilities.
