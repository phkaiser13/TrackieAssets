# TLLM Python Tools

This directory contains Python scripts used for tooling, testing, and orchestration of the TrackieLLM runtime and models.

**Note:** Python is used here as a tool, not as the core runtime language. These scripts are for development, benchmarking, and conversion tasks.

Scripts may include:
- Benchmarking scripts to measure latency and throughput.
- Conversion scripts to prepare models for the C++/Rust runtime.
- High-level integration tests.
